*************************
Simple WSGI Book Database
*************************

This package is a demonstration of a simple WSGI application.

The application has two "routes": ``/`` and ``/book/<id>``.
The root page produces a list of book titles.
Each title is linked to the corresponding "book" page, where the details of that book are shown.

The original source of the "Database" for this application was created by Brian Dorsey.
